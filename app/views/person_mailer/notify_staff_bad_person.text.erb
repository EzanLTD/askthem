Bad Person - There's something wrong with <%= @cached_official.full_name -%>

We couldn't find a person that matches these details:


<%= @cached_official.attributes %>


Typical causes for non-match are use of a nickname or middle name rather than the official name we have for the official.

If you have a link to who, in our data, should match this person, please pass it on to a developer so they can manually match this person.

Thank you,
