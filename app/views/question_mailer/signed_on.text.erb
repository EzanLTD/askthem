Thank you so much for signing on to my question to "<%= @question.title %>" on AskThem, <%= @user.given_name %>

<%= link_to @question.person.name, person_url(@question.state, @question.person.id) %>

Here's a permalink to that question, which you can share over email and on Facebook & Twitter: <%= question_url(@question.state, @question.id) %>

Now I need your help to reach the signature goal and get the question answered.
