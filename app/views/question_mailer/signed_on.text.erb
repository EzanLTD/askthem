Thank you so much for signing on to my question to "<%= @question.title %>" on AskThem, <%= @user.given_name %>

(<%= person_attributes(@question.person) %>)

Body

Now I need your help to reach the goal and get the question answered.

Can you take 10 seconds to share this question:

Here's a permalink to that question, which you can share over email and on Facebook & Twitter: <%= question_url(@question.state, @question.id) %>

Forward this email to friends or click on the question above and share on Facebook.

Facebook is the single most effective way to get more signatures on questions. If we can reach the threshold, the question will get delivered.
