<p>OpenGovernment.org is a RAD project of the Participatory Politics Foundation, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement.
OpenGovernment is supported by a generous grant from the Knight Foundation's "Tech For Engagement" initiative. An open-source and open-data project, our code is available on GitHub and contributions welcome. For more development updates over email & community discussion, join our project Google Group.
