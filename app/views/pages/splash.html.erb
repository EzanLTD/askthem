<p>AskThem is a project of the Participatory Politics Foundation, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement.
AskThem is supported by a charitable grant from the Knight Foundation's <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/tech-engagement/">Tech For Engagement</a> initiative.</p>

<p>AskThem is a free &amp; open-source website for questions-and-answers with public figures. It's a not-for-profit tool for a stronger democratic process, with open data for informed and engaged communities.</p>
	
<p>AskThem allows you to:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Find and ask questions to over 100,000 elected officials nationwide: federal, state and city levels of government.</li>
	<li>Get signatures for your question or petition, have it delivered over email or Twitter, and push for a public response.</li>
	<li>See questions from people near you, sign-on to questions you care about, and review answers from public figures.</li>
	</ul> 

<p>It's like a version of "We The People" for every elected official, from local city council members all the way up to U.S. senators. Sign up now to be the first to ask a question when we launch and see site previews.</p>

<p><strong>Elected officials</strong>: sign up to become a verified responder on AskThem. It's free of charge, and you can answer questions from your constituents in an open public forum. Issue-based organizations and media companies: sign up to help promote questions to government in your area and push for greater public accountability.</p>
